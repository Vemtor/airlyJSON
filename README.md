## Short description
This app scrapes data from the GIOS API https://powietrze.gios.gov.pl/pjp/content/api. 
AirlyJSON first downloads and maps all the necessary data, then prints it to the console. 
To run the app, simply execute the main class. 
You can also find fields in the main class to manage the API links.

## What you need
1. Make sure that you have already java installed. 
2. Project is build on Java 22 with Maven. So please be sure that maven already works on your computer.
3. As mentioned earlier, just run the main class and wait a few seconds. The data should appear shortly! :)
